RTMP Dumper v1.3d

To compile you need the boost libraries, just type

  $ make

To download an rtmp stream use

  $ ./get_iplayer --get 1 --vmode flashhigh --rtmp --rtmpdump "./rtmpdump"

Or for hulu.com (US only)

  $ ./get_hulu url quality

The url is just a programme url like "http://www.hulu.com/watch/48466/30-rock-christmas-special"
and quality is a 0, 1 or 2 to select one of the three available streams, use 1 for high quality rtmp.
